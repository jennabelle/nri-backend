## Background

One of our engineering challenges at NoRedInk is deciding performantly how to show students the right mix of content.  By choosing the right cross-section of content we can ensure that:
  1.  Students achieve content mastery in the least amount of time, and
  2.  Students don't get bored with the same questions.

We base our decision on a number of factors:
  * Student ability
  * Questions students have already seen
  * Pedagogical hierarchy
    ...and more

We have simplifed this problem so that you can actually get something done in a few hours.
